Using a Gaussian Distribution provides sometimes very unlikely results.\n","\n","In order to make this approach useful, the price must be predictable first. When trying to to this using Regression, the overall accuracy is very low (around 60%). One explanation for this is the very low dimensionality of the data. For example there is no information about the size, equipment, age, number of beds, specialities, construction etc. Once the price can be predicted with higher accuracy, multivariant models can be used to predict the effect on the price fpr specific variables, in specific clusters.
